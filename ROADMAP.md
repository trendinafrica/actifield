# Roadmap

Hello there!ðŸ˜ƒ Youâ€™re welcome to the Roadmap of the Actifield project. 

This document identifies the project's vision, its current status, and how to reach the projectâ€™s end goal. It helps contributors keep track of the overall status of the project and recognize where their help is most needed. Please note that the roadmap is subject to change, and that contributions are also welcome to the document.

## Project Vision
We are working with scientists and developers in Ghana to build a local open hardware community to empower scientists to develop their own lab equipment. We are currently working on upgrading, Actifield, a device for behavioural experiments that we developed for neuroscientists.

## Project Summary
Weâ€™re building an equipment called an actimeter. At the simplest, the actimeter is used to measure and record the locomotor activity - how fast or slow a test animal (usually rodents), is moving. This information is useful for several tests such as screening for potentially toxic effects of a new drug on the brain. We developed this project for scientists who need a simple and inexpensive actimeter that can be easily built. 
 
## Milestones

Down below are a list of milestones that represent the overall goals of the project. Preferably, they are to be done in sequential order. But you can help in any task you feel comfortable with

Also, don't forget to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) ðŸ˜‰

### Short term: During Sprint for Internet Health (May 2019)

- [ ] **Get first community contribution**
> A community member files an issue or adds a pull request.

- [ ] **Display live graphs of activity counts on screen**
> Figure out how to make a code sandbox that supports modern web technologies. Research how similar existing tools work: CodePen, jsFiddle, etc.

- [ ] **Display an onscreen grid showing the current location of the mouse in the activity cage**
> Figure out how to make a code sandbox that supports modern web technologies. Research how similar existing tools work: CodePen, jsFiddle, etc.

- [ ] **Build graphical control interface to control the device from the computer**
> Figure out how to make a code sandbox that supports modern web technologies. Research how similar existing tools work: CodePen, jsFiddle, etc.

- [ ] **Check available disk space on SD card before recording counts**
> Figure out how to make a code sandbox that supports modern web technologies. Research how similar existing tools work: CodePen, jsFiddle, etc.


### Medium term: June - August, 2019 

- [ ] **Create manual for users to build or customise the device**
> Figure out how to make a code sandbox that supports modern web technologies. Research how similar existing tools work: CodePen, jsFiddle, etc.

- [ ] **Build project website**
> Figure out how to make a code sandbox that supports modern web technologies. Research how similar existing tools work: CodePen, jsFiddle, etc.

- [ ] **Build project website**
> Build website (Github pages) with useful resources for African scientists interested in developing their own equipment

- [ ] **Organise training workshop**
> Organise training workshop on building open labware for Ghanaian scientists
