  Weâ€™re building an equipment called an actimeter. At the simplest, the actimeter is used to measure and record the locomotor activity - how fast or slow a test animal (usually rodents), is moving. This information is useful for several tests such as screening for potentially toxic effects of a new drug on the brain.
